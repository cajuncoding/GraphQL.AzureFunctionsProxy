Prior Releases Notes:

- Default route is now /graphql/bcp/ instead of /graphql/playground.
- Updated all references to v11 in code, comments, and readme (including some class names) to now reference v11+ for consistency; non-breaking changes as long as custom extensions for proper initialization is used.
- Otherwise there are no other breaking changes other than IDE route path.

- Prior release Changed Repo &amp; Package names to eliminate conflict risks with the core HotChocolate packages.
